# javascript-challenge



## Background

In this exercise I am writing code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset containing UFO sightings using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js. 



### Automatic Table and Date Search

- I create a basic HTML web page using an [index.html](https://github.com/RutgersCodingBootcamp/RUT-JER-DATA-PT-10-2020-U-C/blob/main/02-Homework/14-Intro-To-JavaScript/Instructions/StarterCode/index.html) file.
- Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript  objects, I write code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
- I used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
